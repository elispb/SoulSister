API for returning recipes

Endpoints to far
/recipe - lists all recipes
/recipe/{recipeId} - lists recipe

The plan is to expand into recomending recipes based on time or ingredients and to allow recipes to be added
I also need to convert my favourite recipes to match the model.
I would also like to add allergy information and dietary information in the future
